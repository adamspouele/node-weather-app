You have to get a weather key to access weather datas.

Next instructions explain how to get one :

1 - get a key by signing up here: https://darksky.net/dev/

2 - write your key in the key variable which is in those 2 files :
    
    * app-promise.js
    * weather/weather.js

Now you can get your weather datas by taping your address with this command:
    
    node app.js -a "[your address]"

    or

    node app-promise.js -a "[your address]"
